                        <div>Our guiding principle is the phrase “Do the right thing”. This means taking all aspects of a decision into account and holding them to the light of our core purpose and values to make sure that they are in support. It means doing what is best for our staff members, customers, business partners, and company for the long term, and believing that “right” answers exist.</div>

                        <p className='mb-3'>Our core purpose is to serve our staff members, customers, business partners, and company:</p>
                        <p className='mb-3'>Helping our clients create their future by accelerating the pace of discovery, innovation, development and quality in software engineering. We’re on a worthwhile and important quest. Our services are catered for the complex business solutions across multiple domains. They are part of the fabric of medical, hi-tech and manufacturing industries.</p>
                        <p className='mb-3'>Creating a great place to work where we are all learning, growing, being challenged, enjoying teamwork, and having fun. Symphonize is a special place to work. Our goal is to keep it that way and to make it even better. We want to make Symphonize into the best place to work anywhere. We’re constantly on the lookout for little ways to do so each day. We all share responsibility for the success of Symphonize and share in the fruits of that success.</p>
                        <p className='mb-3'>Winning in the marketplace. We want our products and services to have the greatest possible impact to enterprises across the globe. We pursue these purposes by developing and delivering quality services to clients on time and within budget.</p>
                        <p className='mb-3'>These three purposes form the “compass” that determines how we decide to take on projects, spend our time, and commit our resources. They also provide us with a yardstick beyond just financial to measure our success—our success is how well we do at these endeavors. The core purpose is the abridged version of our mission, see “Mission” down.</p>

                    <div><strong>Core Values</strong></div>
                    <div>
                        <p className='mb-3'>
                            Core values are the essential and enduring principles of Symphonize that define who we are. They are a small set of guiding principles that are integral to our success to date and that function as the framework within which decisions are made. They describe our identity and the beliefs that we truly and passionately hold. These core values are intrinsically important to Symphonize, and do not change with the trends of the day or shift in response to changing market conditions.
                        </p>
                        <p className='mb-3'>
                            That’s not to say that we are perfect at exhibiting these values on a day-to-day basis throughout the organization. We strive to achieve these because they are important to the very core of who we are—but we are still on a journey.
                        </p>
                        <p className='mb-3'>
                            We are explicitly stating our core values because we want the values understood and practiced throughout the organization. When we were smaller, it was easier to spend time with the founders and other key contributors from whom the values originated. As we grow, it is important to more formally articulate and disseminate the values. By being explicit about our values, they are strengthened and focused, and used as practical tools in our business. They are viewed as guideposts when making decisions, and for coaching and developing people.
                        </p>
                        <p className='mb-3'>
                            When people publicly espouse a particular point of view, they become much more likely to behave consistently with that point of view, even if they did not previously hold that point of view. In other words, the very act of stating the values influences behavior toward consistently practicing the values.
                        </p>
                        <p className='mb-3'>
                            Organizations with shared values are more successful than organizations without shared values. To build a strong and viable organization, people must be united in a common cause—united on where they are going, on why they are headed in that direction, and on principles that will guide their journey. Unity exists when people share, support, and endorse the intent of the commonly understood set of values.
