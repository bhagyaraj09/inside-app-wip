                <div>
                  <p>As a software development company, Symphonize takes a very strong stance against the illegal use of software. We respect developers who invest a great deal in their work. We don’t want anyone making unauthorized copies of our software and, likewise, we need to protect against unauthorized use of other software products by members of our staff.</p>
                  <p>Please take responsibility for safeguarding against illegal copies of other software products. If you see a software product that would help in your work, ask your manager to order a legal copy of the program. A legal copy of a program is one that you have the media and manuals to, or one for which we have a multiple-user license. Your manager will contact Systems Services, and they will assist you in obtaining appropriate software, as necessary.</p>
                  <p>Remember, the law states that it is illegal to make or distribute copies of copyrighted material without authorization, including software. Penalties include hefty fines and even jail terms.</p>

                    <li>Acceptable Electronic Mail, Network, and Internet Use Policy – Worldwide</li>
                  </ul> 
                  <p>Electronic mail, Internet access, and other electronic media and equipment are business tools that are provided by Symphonize to our staff to facilitate timely and efficient work. To help ensure that these tools are used appropriately, the company has developed the following acceptable use policy. The enumeration of acceptable and unacceptable uses is in no way intended to imply that these are the only acceptable and unacceptable uses of these systems or the network. In any undefined case, the decision on acceptable use of Symphonize network will be made by Systems Services and the department managers. Symphonize intends to honor the policies set forth below, but reserves the right to change them at any time as may be required under the circumstances.</p>

No one, including individual contributors, managers, or Systems Services, will secretly read or listen to your mail without a reason to do so, and has authorization from the CFO, the Director of Human Resources and Director of Systems Services.</p>
                  <p>Systems Services may monitor the use of its systems in its sole discretion, at any time, with or without notice to any staff member and may bypass any passwords. Such monitoring is capable of tracking and recording email messages sent and received, as well as Internet</p>
                  <p>web sites visited by staff. The purpose of this monitoring is to enable the company to manage its Internet and email resources in a cost-effective and efficient manner and ensure that usage is in accordance with state and federal laws.</p>

                  <p>Systems Services reserves the right to scan, disinfect, or delete any email message or document that appears to contain a virus. You will be notified if one of your files or messages was believed to be infected. Systems Services will take whatever action is necessary to prevent a virus infection from spreading to other files or computers, with or without your explicit consent.</p>

                <div>This policy is intended to be consistent with other Symphonize policies, including the company’s sexual harassment and equal opportunity policies. Symphonize staff are expected to use the Symphonize email and Internet systems in a manner that is consistent with these other policies.

                    <li>Any use to visit gaming (e.g., World of Warcraft, Second Life) or online gambling (e.g., casino games) web sites.</li>
                    <li>Any use of the Symphonize email or Internet systems to develop or send any virus or otherwise destructive program. Staff should not open emails or attachments unless they are confident of the identity of the sender.</li>

                    <li>Use of peer-to-peer (P2P) software. P2P file-sharing applications (such as Kazaa, Skype, Limewire, and Gnutella) are used to share music and other data files between Internet-connected machines, and pose security and illegal copyright risks for Symphonize. Configured incorrectly, they risk allowing anything your desktop machine can read to be downloaded by an unknown third party.</li>
